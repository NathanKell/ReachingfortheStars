	@description = This tank is designed for Service Modules and other upper-stage (pressurized) tanks. It has somewhat less usable volume than a normal tank (and masses slightly more) but allows using some of its volume for electricity and keeps its propellants under pressure (necessary for pressure-fed engines), avoiding ullage issues. It also includes insulation for cryogenic resources.
